Apples are red.
Mangos are orange.
I hate sharks.
The sky is blue.
Grass is green.
Cats are cute.
Dogs are loyal.
Books are educational.
Coffee is hot.
Ice cream is cold.
Mountains are tall.
Rivers are flowing.
Birds can fly.
Fish swim in water.
The sun is bright.
The moon is white.
Snow is cold.
Rain is wet.
Fire is hot.
Sand is rough.
Flowers are beautiful.
Butterflies are colorful.
Music is soothing.
